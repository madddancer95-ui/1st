# üîç COMPREHENSIVE DOMAIN DIAGNOSTIC CHECK - Claude Browser Prompt

## TASK:
I need you to act as a technical diagnostic expert and manually check my domain connection issue. Analyze everything step-by-step and give me a detailed status report.

## BACKGROUND:
- **Working Site**: https://1st-virid.vercel.app (professional tattoo studio - fully functional)
- **Problem Domain**: https://delhitattooshop.com (shows GoDaddy placeholder instead)
- **Previous Action**: May have contacted GoDaddy support (DNS changes can take 24-48 hours)
- **Framework**: Astro static site deployed on Vercel

## WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:

### 1. **DOMAIN ACCESSIBILITY CHECK**
- Visit https://delhitattooshop.com and describe exactly what you see
- Visit https://www.delhitattooshop.com and report status  
- Check if there are SSL certificate issues
- Note any error messages or redirects

### 2. **DNS ANALYSIS**
- Look up current DNS records for delhitattooshop.com
- Identify which servers/IPs it's pointing to
- Compare with typical Vercel DNS patterns
- Estimate if DNS changes are in progress or completed

### 3. **VERCEL INTEGRATION CHECK**  
- Analyze if the domain appears to be connected to Vercel
- Look for signs of domain verification status
- Check for any CDN or hosting provider redirects

### 4. **TIMELINE ASSESSMENT**
- Based on current DNS status, estimate how long until domain works
- Identify if this looks like DNS propagation in progress
- Determine if further action is needed or if we should wait

### 5. **TROUBLESHOOTING RECOMMENDATIONS**
- If domain is NOT working: What specific steps should be taken?
- If DNS changes are in progress: How long to wait and what to monitor?
- If there are errors: What needs to be fixed immediately?

## SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
1. **Is the domain connection working yet?** (Yes/No + details)
2. **Are DNS changes in progress or complete?** 
3. **Should we wait longer or take immediate action?**
4. **What is the expected timeline for full resolution?**
5. **Any critical issues that need fixing right now?**

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please provide a clear status report with:
- ‚úÖ What's working correctly
- ‚ùå What's not working  
- ‚è∞ Timeline expectations
- üîß Recommended next actions
- üö® Any urgent issues

## CONTEXT:
This is a business-critical issue. The professional tattoo studio website is 100% ready (with pain guide, artist portfolios, pricing calculator, Core Web Vitals optimized) but customers can't access it through the main domain. We need to know if we're on track or if something needs immediate attention.

**Please be thorough and give me actionable insights based on what you find during your manual investigation.**
