# üö® VERCEL MANUAL FIX PROMPT - Copy & Paste to Claude Browser

## SITUATION SUMMARY:
I have a professional tattoo studio website (DelhiTattooShop.com) deployed on Vercel. The main site works perfectly at https://1st-virid.vercel.app, but one critical page - the tattoo pain guide - returns 404 despite being built correctly.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- **Working**: Homepage, Artists page, Pricing Calculator
- **404 Issue**: `/tattoo-pain-guide-delhi` page 
- **Framework**: Astro with @astrojs/vercel adapter
- **Build Status**: Successful (10 pages built including pain guide)
- **File Exists**: `.vercel/output/static/tattoo-pain-guide-delhi/index.html` (17.6KB)
- **Local Dev**: Works perfectly on localhost:3001

## ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:
1. Simplified vercel.json configuration
2. Added URL rewrite rules  
3. Enabled cleanUrls and disabled trailingSlash
4. Multiple force rebuilds with timestamp triggers
5. Verified static files are generated correctly

## VERCEL PROJECT INFO:
- **Project Name**: Likely "1st" or similar 
- **Domain**: 1st-virid.vercel.app
- **Custom Domain**: delhitattooshop.com (not yet connected)
- **Framework**: Astro
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`

## WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:
Please provide step-by-step instructions to manually fix this Vercel deployment issue through the Vercel dashboard. I can access:
1. Vercel dashboard
2. Project settings  
3. Build logs
4. Deployment settings
5. Domain configuration

## EXPECTED OUTCOME:
The pain guide should load at `/tattoo-pain-guide-delhi` because it contains high-traffic content (50k+ monthly searches) that's critical for SEO and business growth.

## CURRENT STATUS:
- ‚úÖ Website 95% functional
- ‚úÖ All content ready and optimized
- ‚ùå One routing issue blocking full launch
- ‚è∞ Ready to implement your solution immediately

Please give me detailed steps to diagnose and fix this in the Vercel dashboard manually.
