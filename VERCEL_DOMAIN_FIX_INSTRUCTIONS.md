# üîß VERCEL DOMAIN FIX - Step-by-Step Instructions

## TASK FOR CLAUDE BROWSER:
I need you to guide me through fixing my domain connection in Vercel dashboard. Currently only www.delhitattooshop.com works, but delhitattooshop.com (without www) shows a placeholder. I need both to work.

## CURRENT STATUS:
- ‚úÖ **www.delhitattooshop.com** - Works perfectly (shows professional tattoo site)
- ‚ùå **delhitattooshop.com** - Shows placeholder instead of my site
- **Problem**: Root domain not connected to Vercel project

## WHAT I NEED:
**Detailed step-by-step instructions** to add the root domain (delhitattooshop.com) to my Vercel project so both versions work.

## INFORMATION AVAILABLE:
- **Vercel Project**: "1st" (currently serving 1st-virid.vercel.app)
- **Working URL**: www.delhitattooshop.com
- **Broken URL**: delhitattooshop.com
- **Goal**: Make delhitattooshop.com show the same professional site

## STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE NEEDED:

### 1. **ACCESSING VERCEL DASHBOARD**
- Where to login and find the project
- How to navigate to domain settings

### 2. **ADDING THE ROOT DOMAIN**
- Exact steps to add delhitattooshop.com
- What buttons to click
- What settings to configure

### 3. **DOMAIN CONFIGURATION**  
- How to set up redirect (root ‚Üí www or www ‚Üí root)
- Which option is better for SEO
- Any DNS settings needed

### 4. **VERIFICATION STEPS**
- How to confirm the domain was added correctly
- What status indicators to look for
- Expected timeline for changes

### 5. **TESTING**
- How to test if both domains work
- What to expect during propagation
- How long to wait before testing

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please provide:
- üìù **Clear numbered steps** (like 1, 2, 3...)
- üñ±Ô∏è **Exact button names** and locations to click
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important warnings** or things to avoid
- ‚è∞ **Timeline expectations** for each step
- ‚úÖ **Success indicators** to confirm it worked

## CONTEXT:
This is for a business-critical tattoo studio website. The site is 100% ready and professional, but customers typing the domain without www can't access it. I need simple, foolproof instructions to fix this in Vercel dashboard.

**Please make the instructions so clear that someone can follow them without any technical knowledge.**
