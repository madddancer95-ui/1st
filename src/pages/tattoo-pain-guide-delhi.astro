      <h2>Look, Everyone Asks This Same Question...</h2>
      
      <div class="experience-box">
        <h3>"Bro, how much is this gonna hurt?"</h3>
        <p>I've been tattooing in Delhi for over a decade now, and you know what? This is literally the FIRST question everyone asks me. Like, before they even ask about the price or design, they wanna know about the pain.</p>
        
        <p>And I get it, okay? The fear is real. But here's the thing - I've seen tough-looking guys from Karol Bagh cry over a small wrist tattoo, and then watched this tiny girl from DU get a full back piece without even flinching. So like, it really depends on YOU.</p>

      <h2>💪 Pain Management Secrets (From 10+ Years in Delhi)</h2>
      
      <div class="tip-box">
        <h3>🌟 BEFORE Your Appointment</h3>
        <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; line-height: 2;">
          <li><strong>Eat Well:</strong> Have a proper meal 2 hours before. Low blood sugar = more pain</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep Properly:</strong> Like, actually get 7-8 hours. Tired body feels more pain</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrate:</strong> Drink lots of water day before. Delhi heat dehydrates you anyway</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Alcohol:</strong> No drinking 24 hours before. It thins blood and makes you bleed more</li>
          <li><strong>No Painkillers:</strong> Don't take aspirin or ibuprofen - they increase bleeding</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="tip-box">
        <h3>⚡ DURING Your Session</h3>
        <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; line-height: 2;">
          <li><strong>Breathe:</strong> Deep breathing actually helps. I tell all my clients this</li>
          <li><strong>Talk to Us:</strong> Distract yourself. We love chatting about Delhi, Bollywood, whatever</li>
          <li><strong>Take Breaks:</strong> Don't be a hero. We pause whenever you need it</li>
          <li><strong>Bring Music/Earphones:</strong> Your favorite playlist makes time fly</li>
          <li><strong>Squeeze Something:</strong> Stress ball or just make fists. Helps release tension</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>🤔 Why Some People Handle Pain Better (Delhi Edition)</h2>
      
      <div class="experience-box">
        <p>Look, in my years tattooing people across Delhi - from Punjabi Bagh to Greater Kailash - I've noticed some patterns:</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Tough Ones:</strong> Usually people who've played sports, gym regulars, or anyone who's survived Delhi's summer without AC. Like, if you can handle 45°C heat while traveling in DTC bus, you can handle tattoo pain!</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Surprising Ones:</strong> Some of the most pain-tolerant clients I've had were college girls getting their first tattoo. Meanwhile, bodybuilders sometimes tap out after 30 minutes. Go figure!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Age Factor:</strong> Older clients (30+) usually handle pain better. They've got perspective, you know? Young guys sometimes overthink it.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>🚫 Biggest Mistakes Delhi Clients Make</h2>
      
      <div class="content-grid">
        <div class="pain-chart">
          <h3>❌ Coming Hungover</h3>
          <p>Bro, I can smell the whiskey from yesterday's party. Your pain tolerance is basically zero when hungover. Reschedule, seriously.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="pain-chart">
          <h3>❌ Empty Stomach</h3>
          <p>You think you're being smart by not eating so you won't puke? Wrong move. Empty stomach = dizzy, nauseous, more pain.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="pain-chart">
          <h3>❌ Overthinking</h3>
          <p>The guys who watch YouTube videos about "MOST PAINFUL TATTOO SPOTS" and freak themselves out? They always have the worst time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>💊 What About Numbing Cream? (Honest Opinion)</h2>
      
      <div class="experience-box">
        <p>Everyone asks about numbing cream, and you know what? I'm gonna give you the real deal here.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Good:</strong> Yeah, it works for about 1-2 hours. Can help with initial anxiety.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Bad:</strong> It wears off during longer sessions. Sometimes makes skin swell. Can affect ink absorption.</p>
        
        <p><strong>My Take:</strong> For small tattoos (under 2 hours), go for it if you're really worried. For big pieces? You're gonna have to deal with pain anyway, so might as well get used to it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What We Provide:</strong> We have medical-grade numbing options available. Just ask during consultation.</p>

      </div>
      
      <div class="tip-box">
