# ðŸ”— DOMAIN CONNECTION FIX - Claude Browser Prompt

## SITUATION:
My professional tattoo website works perfectly on Vercel (https://1st-virid.vercel.app) but my custom domain (delhitattooshop.com) still shows a GoDaddy placeholder page. We identified DNS is pointing to GoDaddy servers instead of Vercel.

## CURRENT DNS STATUS:
- delhitattooshop.com â†’ points to 76.76.19.61 (GoDaddy)
- 1st-virid.vercel.app â†’ points to 64.29.17.131 (Vercel)
- Issue: Need to redirect DNS from GoDaddy to Vercel

## ALREADY TRIED:
- Added domain in vercel.json
- Multiple Vercel deployments 
- Created GoDaddy support script last night

## OPTIONS I NEED HELP WITH:
1. **GoDaddy DNS Update Instructions** - Step by step to change DNS records myself
2. **Vercel Domain Setup** - Ensure domain is properly added in Vercel dashboard  
3. **Alternative Solutions** - If DNS changes aren't working
4. **Troubleshooting** - What to check if domain still doesn't connect

## GOAL:
Get delhitattooshop.com to show my professional tattoo studio site instead of the placeholder.

## TECHNICAL INFO:
- Framework: Astro static site
- Hosting: Vercel project "1st"
- Domain registrar: GoDaddy
- Current working URL: 1st-virid.vercel.app

Please provide detailed steps for the fastest way to connect this domain.
