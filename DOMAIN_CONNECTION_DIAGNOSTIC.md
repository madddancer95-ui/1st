# üîó DOMAIN CONNECTION DIAGNOSTIC - Copy & Paste to Claude Browser

## SITUATION SUMMARY:
My professional tattoo studio website is fully functional on Vercel at https://1st-virid.vercel.app, but the custom domain delhitattooshop.com still shows a "Launching Soon" placeholder page instead of connecting to my Vercel deployment.

## CURRENT STATUS:
- ‚úÖ **Vercel Site**: https://1st-virid.vercel.app - FULLY WORKING
  - Professional design, all pages load
  - Tattoo pain guide, artists, pricing calculator
  - Optimized images, Core Web Vitals optimized
- ‚ùå **Custom Domain**: https://delhitattooshop.com - Shows "Launching Soon" placeholder

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- **Domain Registrar**: GoDaddy (assumed based on placeholder page style)
- **Current Hosting**: Appears to be GoDaddy Website Builder placeholder
- **Target Deployment**: Vercel project "1st" (1st-virid.vercel.app)
- **Framework**: Astro with static generation
- **Domain**: delhitattooshop.com + www.delhitattooshop.com

## DOMAIN CONNECTION ATTEMPTS:
- Added domain to vercel.json configuration
- Domain listed in Vercel project settings
- Multiple deployments completed successfully

## WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:
I need step-by-step instructions to:

1. **Diagnose why delhitattooshop.com isn't pointing to Vercel**
2. **Check DNS settings and identify the issue**
3. **Configure domain connection properly** (Vercel dashboard + domain registrar)
4. **Replace the GoDaddy placeholder with my professional site**
5. **Ensure both www and non-www versions work**

## ACCESS AVAILABLE:
- Vercel dashboard (project "1st")
- Domain registrar account (likely GoDaddy)
- Can modify DNS records
- Can change hosting settings

## EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- delhitattooshop.com ‚Üí shows my professional tattoo website
- www.delhitattooshop.com ‚Üí redirects to main domain
- "Launching Soon" placeholder completely replaced
- All SEO and performance optimizations preserved

## URGENCY:
This is blocking the business launch. The website is 100% ready but customers can't access it through the main domain. Need to get this resolved to start capturing the 50k+ monthly search traffic from our optimized content.

Please provide detailed steps to diagnose and fix the domain connection issue, covering both Vercel configuration and domain registrar settings.
